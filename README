** THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT READY YET, but feel free to poke **

Place the WordPress folder in your CodeSniffer/Standards folder.

This requires PHP CodeSniffer:
http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/

And ant
http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

# Install CodeSniffer (if you don't already have it)
pear install PHP_CodeSniffer

# Check out a local copy of wordpress-codesniffer
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/kurtpayne/wordpress-codesniffer.git

# Install to CodeSniffer
ln -s wordpress-codesniffer/WordPress /usr/lib/php/pear/PHP/CodeSniffer/Standards/WordPress

# Run with ant
mkdir -p /tmp/plugin
cp myplugin.zip /tmp/plugin.zip
ant -Dbuild_src=/tmp/plugin

# Now look around in /tmp/plugin/logs
cd /tmp/plugin/logs
