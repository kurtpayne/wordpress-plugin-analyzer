** THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT READY YET, but feel free to poke **

Place the WordPress folder in your CodeSniffer/Standards folder.

This requires PHP CodeSniffer:
http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/

# Install CodeSniffer (if you don't already have it)
pear install PHP_CodeSniffer

# Check out a local copy of wordpress-codesniffer
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/kurtpayne/wordpress-codesniffer.git

# Install to CodeSniffer
ln -s wordpress-codesniffer/WordPress /usr/lib/php/pear/PHP/CodeSniffer/Standards/WordPress

# Run CodeSniffer
phpcs --standard=WordPress /path/to/my/files/*

TODO:
 * I'd like to host this somewhere so people could upload a plugin / theme zip
and have this run a set of tests automatically.  I just need to find the time
to make that happen.

 * Tie into Zend Code Analyzer

 * Submit readme.txt (if found) to http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/about/validator/

 * Validate phpdoc rules (probaby doclbox for performance)

 * Validate with csslint https://github.com/stubbornella/csslint/wiki/Command-line-interface

 * Run through RIPS scanner

 * Run through phpmd

 * Run through php compat info
